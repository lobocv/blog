This is the backbone of the event-driven architecture model. In this model, services send messages to a message broker, which then distributes (publishes) the messages to interested (subscribed) clients. A message can be used to describe an event in the system, such as the creation or update of an entity. This allows you to loosely couple different components of your system by having them publish or subscribe to events that they care about.</description></item></channel></rss>
