</div>
<p>One of the prevailing forms of communication in modern microservice architectures is asynchronous messaging.
This is the backbone of the event-driven architecture model. In this model, services send messages to a message
broker, which then distributes (publishes) the messages to interested (subscribed) clients. A message can be used to
describe an event in the system, such as the creation or update of an entity. This allows you to loosely couple different
components of your system by having them publish or subscribe to events that they care about.</p>
<p>But what happens if there is a subscriber that wants to react to a group of events as an aggregate? In other words, what
if you wanted to do something only after all the <code>update</code> events stop being published, rather than reacting to each and
every one as they come in?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a concrete example.</p>
<h3 id=aggregating-social-media-metrics>Aggregating Social Media Metrics</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you are building a system that collects metrics on your social media posts. Your system needs to provide both an individual
view of post performance and view of posts' performance as a whole. Let&rsquo;s call metrics on individual posts <code>post-level</code> metrics
and metrics on your posts as a whole <code>account-level</code> metrics. To keep things simple, let&rsquo;s assume all post-level metrics can
be aggregated using a sum:</p>
<p style=text-align:center>$M_{account} = \sum_{i=0}^{N_{posts}} M_{post_{i}}$</p>
<p>From the equation above, it is clear that account-level metrics depend on the post-level metrics. Every time a metric on a post changes, we will
need to recompute this sum[1]. In an event-driven architecture, you may have a service that performs this aggregation by
listening to <code>post-metric-updated</code> events. If many of these events are produced within a short period of time, the service
will be computing this sum many times over, with only the last computation being valuable (all other computations would produce
a stale value). What we would really like to do in this situation is detect when the last <code>post-metric-updated</code> event comes
in and only then compute the sum. But how do we know which event is the last?</p>
<p>Determining which event is last is actually a difficult problem and can&rsquo;t be solved in a general context. The concept of &ldquo;last&rdquo;
is application specific. In our example, a post can have it&rsquo;s metrics updated at any time. If we are okay with some degree
of staleness to our account metrics, we can implement a delayed computation that occurs only after we stop receiving events for
a certain amount of time.</p>
<h3 id=the-ideal-event>The Ideal Event</h3>
<p>Ideally, what we would like to have is to have a slightly different event than our <code>post-metric-updated</code> event. What we really
want is a <code>post-metric-last-updated-X-minutes-ago</code> event, where <code>X</code> is some acceptable delay. If each <code>post-metric-updated</code>
event contains a list of all the updated metrics, then the <code>post-metric-last-updated-X-minutes-ago</code> event should contain
the superset of all the metrics that were updated. Let&rsquo;s define the time duration, <code>X</code>, the <code>folding window</code> because it is
the minimum duration of time at which similar events will be folded into a single event.</p>
<p>But how do we produce such an event?</p>
<p>We will need some code that will do the following for each account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen for <code>post-metric-updated</code> events</li>
<li>Keep a super-set of all the updated metrics in the events</li>
<li>Keep track of the last time a <code>post-metric-updated</code> event comes in</li>
<li>Produce a <code>post-metric-last-updated-X-minutes-ago</code> when we don&rsquo;t receive an event for <code>X</code> minutes</li>
</ul>
<p>This turns out to be fairly simple to implement with the use of Redis <a href=https://redis.io/topics/data-types>sorted-sets</a>.</p>
<h3 id=sorted-set>Sorted Set</h3>
<p>A sorted set is a <em>unique</em> collection of strings that have an associated <code>score</code>. The score is used to sort the entries
within the set.
For example, a sorted set would be a perfect data structure for storing a user scoreboard:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rank</th>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Highscore</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Sharon</td>
<td>1050</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>Abdul</td>
<td>800</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Calvin</td>
<td>780</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Pirakalan</td>
<td>660</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Nirav</td>
<td>600</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can insert the data above into the sorted set in any order and it will maintain the entries in the order of high-score.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html>&gt;&gt; ZADD highscores 780 Calvin

&gt;&gt; (integer) 1
&gt;&gt; ZADD highscores 800 Abdul
&gt;&gt; (integer) 1
</code></pre></div><p>It is then very simple to ask the sorted set for the top <code>N</code> results with <a href=https://redis.io/commands/zrevrange>ZREVRANGE</a>.
(You could also get the results sorted by ascending order by using <a href=https://redis.io/commands/zrange>ZRANGE</a>)</p>

(integer) 1
</code></pre></div><h3 id=folding-events>Folding Events</h3>
<p>Since the sorted set can only have unique values, we can use it to &ldquo;fold&rdquo; a group of events into a single event.
In order to do that, we need to remove unique information from the events such that they serialize to the
same string value. We can use the time of the event as the <code>score</code> in the sorted-set. Each time an event is added, we update
the <code>score</code>, thus keeping track of the last event in the group. Our sorted-set then holds a time-ordered collection
of events, where each element represents a folded view of events from each group. We can then regularly query the
sorted-set with <code>ZRANGEBYSCORE</code> to get values with timestamps (scores) before <code>time.Now()-X</code>.
These values are then published as <code>post-metric-last-updated-X-minutes-ago</code> events and removed from the sorted set[2].</p>
<p>Back to our example, the <code>post-metric-updated</code> event has the following schema:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>// PostMetricUpdatedEvent is published when metrics change on a post. It contains the changed metric values.
type PostMetricUpdatedEvent struct {
	PostID string                      `json:&quot;id&quot;`
	AccountID string                   `json:&quot;account_id&quot;`
	UpdatedMetrics map[string]float64  `json:&quot;metrics&quot;`
}
</code></pre><p>And we have the following events being published, shown below in their JSON serialized form:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;post_1&quot;, &quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_1&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: {&quot;likes&quot;: 10, &quot;shares&quot;: 5}}
{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;post_2&quot;, &quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_1&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: {&quot;comments&quot;: 25, &quot;impressions&quot;: 16}}
{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;post_3&quot;, &quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_1&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: {&quot;likes&quot;: 5, &quot;shares&quot;: 2}}
{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;post_4&quot;, &quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_1&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: {&quot;comments&quot;: 33, &quot;impressions&quot;: 8}}
{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;post_5&quot;, &quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_2&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: {&quot;likes&quot;: 12, &quot;shares&quot;: 15}}
{&quot;id&quot;: &quot;post_6&quot;, &quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_2&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: {&quot;likes&quot;: 3, &quot;shares&quot;: 1}}
</code></pre><p>These 6 events span two unique accounts (<code>account_1</code> and <code>account_2</code>) and should therefore ideally create two separate
<code>post-metric-last-updated-X-minutes-ago</code> events. Remember, a sorted set stores <em>unique</em> strings, so we cannot just
insert these JSON strings into the sorted-set as is. If we did, they would be stored as 6 different entries in the set.
We need to identify the <code>group key</code> for all the events that we want to fold.
The group key should remove all uniquely identifying information in the event such that events within the same group have the same
serialized value. In our example, the group key would be just the <code>account_id</code> field, since we just want one event per account:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>{&quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_1&quot;}
{&quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_2&quot;}
</code></pre><p>But wait&mldr; We just lost a bunch of information from our events! That&rsquo;s right. I never said this folding was lossless!
In some cases this may be acceptable, you may be able to gather that information elsewhere, say from an API call, or it
may not be relevant for what you are trying to do on the subscriber side.</p>
<p>In cases where you <em>do</em> need that information, we can store it separately in a database as we are inserting values into
the sorted-set. When querying the sorted-set for events to publish, we can &ldquo;unfold&rdquo; the event by enriching it with
the information we stored in the database.</p>
<p>In our example, we need a list of metrics that have changed so that we know which metrics to aggregate.
We can easily keep track of these metrics in a regular Redis set. When we query the sorted-set to get
the folded event older than <code>X</code>, we also grab the metrics that have changed from the regular set. We can then assemble
the <code>post-metric-last-updated-X-minutes-ago</code> event:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>type PostMetricUpdatedEvent  struct {
	AccountID string        `json:&quot;account_id&quot;`
	UpdatedMetrics []string `json:&quot;metrics&quot;`
}
</code></pre><p>which in our example looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex=0><code>{&quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_1&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: [&quot;likes&quot;, &quot;shares&quot;, &quot;comments&quot;, &quot;impressions&quot;]}
{&quot;account_id&quot;: &quot;account_2&quot;, &quot;metrics&quot;: [&quot;likes&quot;, &quot;shares&quot;]}
</code></pre><p>The service performing the aggregation can then subscribe to these events and be notified only once metrics have stopped
being updated. We can rest assured that we will compute the value at most once in the <code>X</code> minutes since the
last time a post metric was updated.</p>
<h3 id=folding-ratio>Folding Ratio</h3>
<p>To get a feel for how long we should set our folding window to be, we can calculate the folding ratio, ${F}_{R}$:</p>
<p style=text-align:center>${F}_{R}=\frac{N_F}{N_E}$</p>
<p>where $N_E$ = Number of fold-eligible events and $N_F$ = Number of actually folded events.</p>
<p>When inserting into a Redis sorted-set with the <code>ZADD</code> operator, Redis will tell you how many new elements were added to
the sorted-set (score updates excluded). Assuming we are inserting one event at a time, the number of folded events is
measured by how many times the <code>ZADD</code> operation returns <code>0</code> and the number of new events is measured by how many times
<code>ZADD</code> returns <code>1</code>. With this in mind, we can measure the following values:</p>
<p style=text-align:center>$N_E= N_{Total} - Count(ZADD == 1)$</p>
<p style=text-align:center>$N_F$ = Count(ZADD == 0)</p>
<p style=text-align:center>$F_R = \frac{Count(ZADD == 0)}{N_{Total} - Count(ZADD == 1)}$</p>
<p>where $N_{Total}$ is the total number of events.</p>
<p>But there is a caveat; we are also popping elements off of the sorted set in order to publish the folded event.
If the folding window is too short for the timing of our incoming events, we are going to be removing an element
from the sorted set just before adding a new event that would have otherwise been folded.
In this situation, we will be over measuring our number of new events and under measuring the number of folded events.
Another way to look at this is that the value of <code>ZADD</code> only acts as a proxy for the folded count from <em>Redis</em>' perspective.</p>
<p>Below is an example of what that could look like:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-html data-lang=html>{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;post_1&#34;, &#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_1&#34;, &#34;metrics&#34;: {&#34;likes&#34;: 10, &#34;shares&#34;: 5}}  -&gt; ZADD Returns 1 (new) 
{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;post_2&#34;, &#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_1&#34;, &#34;metrics&#34;: {&#34;likes&#34;: 25, &#34;shares&#34;: 16}} -&gt; ZADD Returns 0 (folded)
{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;post_3&#34;, &#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_1&#34;, &#34;metrics&#34;: {&#34;likes&#34;: 5, &#34;shares&#34;: 2}}   -&gt; ZADD Returns 0 (folded)

                    Publish folded event  {&#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_1&#34;}

{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;post_4&#34;, &#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_1&#34;, &#34;metrics&#34;: {&#34;likes&#34;: 33, &#34;shares&#34;: 8}}  -&gt; ZADD Returns 1 (fake new)
{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;post_5&#34;, &#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_2&#34;, &#34;metrics&#34;: {&#34;likes&#34;: 12, &#34;shares&#34;: 15}} -&gt; ZADD Returns 0 (new)

                    Publish folded event  {&#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_2&#34;}

{&#34;id&#34;: &#34;post_6&#34;, &#34;account_id&#34;: &#34;account_2&#34;, &#34;metrics&#34;: {&#34;likes&#34;: 3, &#34;shares&#34;: 1}}   -&gt; ZADD Returns 1 (fake new)
</code></pre></div><p>If your system is processing a large number of folded events ($N_{Total} \gg Count(ZADD == 1)$) and your folding
window is reasonable[3], then the error becomes negligible and the folding ratio simplifies further:</p>
<p style=text-align:center>${F}_{R}\approx\frac{Count(ZADD == 0)}{N_{Total}}$</p>
<p>If it is really important that you have the most optimal folding ratio, you will need to do some offline analysis such as looking
at historical events within a time range. In this case, you will actually know the number of events that should be folded.
In most cases, the timing of your events will be irregularly spaced and you will never consistently achieve 100% folding.
Even then, <em>any</em> non-zero folding is still cutting the amount of work your system is doing.</p>
<p>The example we have been using throughout this article is a real world scenario. In production we see anywhere between
85% and 98% folding over hundreds of thousands of events per day. Without event folding, we would have overloaded our
database a long time ago and be forced to drop our event-driven approach in favour of something more traditional such
as scheduled cron jobs.</p>
<h3 id=placement-of-the-event-folder>Placement of the Event Folder</h3>
<p>The event folder can be placed on either the publisher side or on the consumer side. Where you
decide to place the event folder ultimately comes down to how many consumers want folded events. By folding on the
publisher side, you can reduce complexity for consumers downstream. However, if only one consumer cares about folding
events, it may be cleaner to place the event folder on the consumer side and not have to make any changes at the producer.
If you place the event folder on the publisher side, there is nothing wrong with publishing both folded and
unfolded events, just be sure to place them on separate topics to prevent confusion.</p>
<h3 id=another-use-case-database-syncing>Another Use-case: Database Syncing</h3>
<p>Another use-case where the event folder is highly effective is during database syncing. In a
<a href=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html>CQRS</a> pattern,
we can separate database technologies used for writing and reading by syncing all writes to the read database. Some databases
such as ElasticSearch perform poorly for document updates[4]. Using an event folder we can reduce the number of
writes to ElasticSearch, significantly reducing the number of deleted documents that need to be garbage collected.</p>
<h3 id=a-powerful-tool>A Powerful Tool</h3>
<p>The event folder can be a powerful tool in your system&rsquo;s architecture. It can be the difference in an event driven
system&rsquo;s viability. The event folder I have outlined in this article is designed around transient spikes in
events. If your events are not transient, you may find that your folded events may never be published due to a
constantly resetting folding window. With a few adjustments, this design can be used for non-transient event streams
as well.</p>
<h3 id=appendix>Appendix</h3>
<p>[1] Many social networks provide APIs for gathering account level metrics so you don&rsquo;t need to do this aggregation yourself.
However, there are certain metrics which are not supported and cause us to have to do the aggregation ourselves.</p>
<p>[2] While Redis sorted-sets do have the ability to atomically pop elements from the top or bottom of the sorted set, it
unfortunately does not have an atomic way to query and remove elements from the middle. This means that we have to make
two separate commands: <code>ZRANGE</code> to get the values and <code>ZREM</code> to remove the key after we publish the event.
The consequence of this is that there is are race conditions if you have multiple threads looking for folded events
to publish. This means a folded event can be published more than once. If this is a real issue you can consider using
global locks or partitioning the key-space, with the trade-off of added complexity.</p>
<p>[3] You should have some reasonable initial guess for your folding window. If not, take a sampling of events and
determine it retrospectively offline. If your latency requirements allow for it, start with a larger folding window and
gradually reduce it while monitoring your folding ratio.</p>
<p>[4] Even though ElasticSearch has APIs for updating documents, under the hood it is actually indexing a new document and
marking the old document for deletion.</p>
